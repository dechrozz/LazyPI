# LazyPI
This is an addon, which creates a PI Makro named "LazyPI", if it hasnt created one before, otherwise it would update that makro after clicking on a Teammate's button.

# How to open
You can open the addon by writing /lpi or /LPI.

# Known Issues
I am having trouble with the DPS role icon and are also working on a spec icon, so the player can decide which icon he would like to see.

# Roadmap
1. fixing dps role icon and adding spec role icon
2. adding minimap button
3. adding suggestions like a "go to option" or an dps leaderboard
4. UI UX Update
